# Design Reference Screenshots

## Important Note
- Ignore the black "curated by Mobbin" banner at the bottom of screenshots
- All text content must be reproduced EXACTLY as shown in screenshots
- Extract precise color values, spacing, and typography

## Priority Order (MVP Focus)
1. **landing-page/** - Highest priority for Week 1
2. **ios/onboarding/** - User registration flow
3. **ios/creating-profile/** - Profile setup
4. **ios/home/** - Main navigation and skill tree
5. **ios/completing-first-lesson/** - Core learning experience

## Organization
- Each folder should contain screenshots for that specific flow
- Use descriptive filenames: hero-section.png, cta-buttons.png, etc.
- Document any text content in accompanying .md files
