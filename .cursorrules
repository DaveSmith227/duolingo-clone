# Duolingo Clone Development Rules

## Design System Priority
- ALWAYS match screenshots exactly for landing page elements
- Ignore "curated by Mobbin" banners in screenshot analysis
- Extract text content exactly as written in screenshots
- Use design tokens from design-reference/ folder analysis

## MVP Scope Enforcement
- Only implement P0 features from duolingo-mvp-scope.md
- Reject requests for P1 or out-of-scope features during MVP phase
- Focus on pixel-perfect landing page first (Week 1 priority)

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript for all React components
- Implement responsive design mobile-first
- Use Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- Analyze screenshots before building components
- Ask for screenshot clarification when UI is unclear
- Suggest design token extraction when building new components
- Remind about MVP scope when suggesting features
