### Notes

- Analytics endpoints are the main missing piece from the PRD requirements
- Most authentication, health check, admin, and profile endpoints already exist
- Rate limiting and response formatting need to be standardized across all endpoints
- Use `pytest backend/app/tests/` to run all tests
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase for consistency

2. **Pattern-Based Endpoint Classification**: URL pattern matching for flexible endpoint categorization
3. **Multi-Level Identification**: Combined IP and user-based tracking for accurate rate limiting
4. **Fail-Open Strategy**: Redis failures allow requests to proceed (availability over strict limits)
5. **Standardized Error Responses**: Integration with existing response formatter for consistency
6. **Configurable Exclusions**: Flexible path exclusion system for documentation and static files
7. **Header Transparency**: Comprehensive rate limit headers for client awareness and debugging

#### Files Modified/Created:

**New Files Created:**
- `backend/app/middleware/rate_limiting.py` (330 lines) - Rate limiting middleware implementation
- `backend/app/middleware/test_rate_limiting.py` (585 lines) - Comprehensive test suite

**Modified Files:**

#### Rate Limiting Configuration:

**Endpoint Pattern Mapping:**
- `/api/auth/*`, `/api/login`, `/api/admin/*` → Auth limits (5/min)
- `/api/users/*`, `/api/profile/*` → User limits (60/min)
- `/api/analytics/*`, `/api/events/*` → Analytics limits (100/min)
- `/api/health/*`, `/health` → Health limits (30/min)
- All other endpoints → General limits (120/min)

**Rate Limit Headers:**
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1704110460

## Implementation Review - Task 5.0: Enhance Health Check Endpoints

### Completed Implementation (Date: 2025-01-05)

#### Changes Implemented:

1. **Redis Health Service (`app/services/redis_health_service.py`)**:
   - `RedisHealthService`: Comprehensive Redis health monitoring service with connectivity checks, performance metrics, and status determination
   - `RedisHealthInfo` dataclass: Structured health information with status, connection state, response times, and detailed metrics
   - `RedisHealthStatus` enum: Health status levels (HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY, UNAVAILABLE)
   - Multi-dimensional health assessment including response time thresholds, memory usage analysis, and fragmentation detection
   - Cache hit/miss tracking for application-level metrics
   - Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation for Redis failures

2. **Enhanced Health Check Endpoints (`app/api/health.py`)**:
   - `GET /api/health/cache`: New Redis-specific health endpoint returning detailed cache metrics, memory usage, and connection pool status
   - `GET /api/health/detailed`: Enhanced detailed health check with Redis integration, system metrics, and comprehensive monitoring
   - Updated `GET /api/health/system`: Includes Redis status in services monitoring
   - Updated `GET /api/health/ready`: Includes Redis status for readiness assessment (non-critical)
   - Updated `GET /api/health/metrics`: Comprehensive metrics including Redis performance data
   - Standardized response formatting with proper HTTP status codes and error handling

3. **Health Check Response Models**:
   - `RedisHealthResponse`: Dedicated Redis health check response model
   - `CacheHealthResponse`: Cache-specific health response with performance metrics
   - `DetailedHealthResponse`: Enhanced detailed health response including Redis and system metrics
   - All models use standardized response formatting with timestamps and request IDs

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite (`app/api/test_health_redis.py`)**:
   - 25 comprehensive unit tests covering all Redis health functionality (100% pass rate)
   - Redis health service tests: connectivity, timeouts, errors, performance thresholds, memory usage
   - Health endpoint integration tests: cache endpoint, detailed endpoint, system endpoint
   - Mock Redis failure scenarios: connection errors, timeouts, slow responses, high memory usage
   - Cache metrics tracking and reset functionality tests
   - Global service singleton pattern validation

#### Technical Decisions and Reasoning:

1. **Service-Based Architecture**: Created dedicated `RedisHealthService` for separation of concerns and reusability across endpoints
2. **Multi-Level Status Assessment**: Health status determined by multiple factors (response time, memory fragmentation, memory usage) for comprehensive monitoring
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Service remains functional even with Redis failures, providing monitoring visibility without breaking application functionality
4. **Performance Thresholds**: Intelligent thresholds for response time (500ms degraded, 1000ms unhealthy) and memory usage (90% degraded, 95% unhealthy)
5. **Cache Metrics Integration**: Application-level cache hit/miss tracking complements Redis server metrics for comprehensive performance monitoring
6. **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with detailed metadata for debugging and monitoring
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Mock-based testing ensures reliability without requiring actual Redis instances
