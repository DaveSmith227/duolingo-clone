### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm run test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Vitest configuration.
- Each sub-task includes Definition of Done (DoD) criteria to help junior developers understand when a task is complete.
- File suggestions are informed by existing codebase patterns and available dependencies.

### Memory Optimization Update

We resolved critical JavaScript heap out-of-memory errors by implementing a comprehensive testing strategy with separate configurations for different test types:

- **vitest.config.unit.ts** - Unit tests with Node environment and vmThreads pool
- **vitest.config.dom.ts** - DOM tests with jsdom and single fork execution
- **vitest.config.design-system.ts** - Design system tests with extreme memory optimization
- **docs/testing-memory-optimization.md** - Complete documentation of memory issues and solutions

Key improvements:
- Switched from happy-dom to jsdom for better stability
- Used Node environment for non-DOM tests (much lighter)
- Implemented vmThreads pool with memory limits (512MB per worker)
- Added garbage collection and heap monitoring
- Created specialized test scripts for different test categories

## Task 4.1 Summary: Puppeteer Screenshot Capture & Memory Optimization

### What Was Accomplished

**Puppeteer Screenshot Capture Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive multi-viewport screenshot capture system in `/frontend/src/lib/design-system/validator/puppeteer-capture.ts`
- Implemented predefined viewports for mobile, tablet, and desktop configurations
- Added support for custom viewports and responsive breakpoints
- Built browser resource management with initialization and cleanup
- Created comprehensive test suite with 21 passing tests

**Critical Memory Issue Resolution:**
Before proceeding with visual validation, we discovered and resolved a systemic memory issue affecting the entire test suite:

**Problem Identified:**
- JavaScript heap out of memory errors across multiple test files
- Happy-DOM memory leaks with large test suites
- DOM not resetting between tests causing memory accumulation
- Using DOM environment for tests that don't need it

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Separated Test Configurations**: Created specialized Vitest configs for different test types
2. **Environment Optimization**: Node for unit tests, jsdom for DOM tests (removed happy-dom)
3. **Memory Management**: vmThreads pool with 512MB limits, single fork execution, garbage collection
4. **Test Organization**: Separate scripts for unit, DOM, and design system tests

**Results:**
- Memory usage reduced from heap overflow to stable 22MB max
- All design system tests passing (200+ tests)
- Improved test execution speed and stability
- Clear testing strategy documented in `/frontend/docs/testing-memory-optimization.md`

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Puppeteer Mocking**: Used simplified mock approach to avoid complex hoisting issues
2. **Viewport Strategy**: Predefined common viewports with utility functions for custom sizes
3. **Resource Management**: Explicit cleanup methods to prevent browser process leaks
4. **Memory Pool Selection**: vmThreads for unit tests (parallel), forks for DOM tests (sequential)
5. **Environment Selection**: Node environment as default, jsdom only when DOM required

This task not only implemented the screenshot capture functionality but also resolved a critical infrastructure issue that was blocking all test development. The memory optimization work ensures we can continue building the visual validation system without encountering heap overflow errors.

### Technical Decisions and Reasoning

1. **Multi-Viewport Strategy**: Implemented predefined viewports (mobile: 375x667, tablet: 768x1024, desktop: 1920x1080) to ensure consistent testing across device types
2. **Memory Pool Architecture**: Used vmThreads for unit tests (parallel processing) and forks for DOM tests (memory isolation) to prevent heap overflow
3. **Visualization Modes**: Created multiple modes to serve different use cases - developers need different views for different types of visual differences
4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Implemented both perceptual (SSIM) and pixel-level metrics to provide complete validation coverage
5. **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching based on file timestamps and configuration changes to balance performance with accuracy
6. **Error Boundary Design**: Graceful handling of browser failures, image loading errors, and processing timeouts
7. **Report Generation**: Multiple output formats (HTML, Markdown) to serve different consumption needs
8. **Configuration Flexibility**: Extensive options for thresholds, algorithms, and processing parameters

### Integration Points

- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Visual diff engine integrates with backend AI vision services for enhanced comparison
- **CLI Integration**: Validation system accessible through command-line tools for developer workflow
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Designed for integration with GitHub Actions for automated validation
