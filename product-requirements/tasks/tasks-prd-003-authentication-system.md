### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `auth.py` and `auth.test.py` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run frontend tests. Use `pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run backend tests.
- Each sub-task includes Definition of Done (DoD) criteria to help junior developers understand when a task is complete.
- File suggestions are informed by existing codebase patterns and available dependencies (FastAPI, Supabase, Next.js, Zustand).
- Authentication system integrates with existing user models in `backend/app/models/user.py`.
