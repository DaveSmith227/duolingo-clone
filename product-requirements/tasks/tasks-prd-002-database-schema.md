# Tasks for Database Schema Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `backend/app/models/user.py` - User management models (User, OAuthProvider).
- `backend/app/models/test_user.py` - Unit tests for user models.
- `backend/app/models/course.py` - Course content structure models (Language, Course, Section, Unit, Lesson).

- `backend/app/models/test_progress.py` - Unit tests for progress models.
- `backend/app/models/gamification.py` - Gamification models (UserDailyXP, UserHeartsLog, Achievement, UserAchievement).
- `backend/app/models/test_gamification.py` - Unit tests for gamification models.
- `backend/app/models/audit.py` - Audit logging models (UserActivityLog, SystemAuditLog).
- `backend/app/models/test_audit.py` - Unit tests for audit models.

- `backend/app/models/__init__.py` - Model imports and registry.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `UserModel.py` and `test_user_model.py` in the same directory).
- Use `pytest` from the backend directory to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- Each sub-task includes Definition of Done (DoD) criteria to help junior developers understand when a task is complete.
- File suggestions are informed by existing codebase patterns and available dependencies.
