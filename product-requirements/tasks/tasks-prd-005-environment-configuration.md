### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `config.py` and `config.test.py` in the same directory).
- Use `npx vitest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run frontend tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Vitest configuration.
- Use `pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run backend tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- Each sub-task includes Definition of Done (DoD) criteria to help junior developers understand when a task is complete.
- File suggestions are informed by existing codebase patterns and available dependencies.
