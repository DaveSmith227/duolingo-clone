# Backend Architecture PRD

## Overview

This PRD defines the FastAPI application structure, file organization, and core configuration for the Duolingo clone backend. The primary goal is to establish a scalable, maintainable backend architecture that supports the MVP learning experience while addressing the current critical issue where Python files were incorrectly created as directories.

## Goals

- **Fix corrupted backend structure**: Remove directory files and create proper Python files
- **Establish FastAPI application foundation**: Create a well-organized, scalable backend architecture
- **Enable core functionality**: Support user authentication, course management, and exercise delivery
- **Ensure maintainability**: Implement clear separation of concerns and modular design
- **Support MVP timeline**: Provide foundation for Week 1 deliverables

## User Stories

**As a backend developer**, I want a clean, organized FastAPI application structure so that I can efficiently implement new features and maintain existing code.

**As a frontend developer**, I want well-documented API endpoints with consistent response formats so that I can integrate frontend components seamlessly.

**As a DevOps engineer**, I want a properly configured application with clear environment management so that I can deploy and monitor the system effectively.

**As a product manager**, I want a scalable backend architecture that can grow with the product so that we can add new features without major refactoring.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Specific API endpoints for user management (covered in separate PRD)
- Database schema design (covered in separate PRD)
- Authentication flow implementation (covered in separate PRD)
- Deployment configuration (covered in separate PRD)
- Exercise content management (covered in future PRDs)
- Mobile app API considerations (future phase)

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- FastAPI 0.104.1 for web framework
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.23 for database ORM

- Pydantic 2.5.0 for data validation
- Python-jose 3.3.0 for JWT handling
- Passlib 1.7.4 for password hashing
- Python-dotenv 1.0.0 for environment management

### Architecture Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access layer
- Dependency injection for database sessions
- Environment-based configuration
- Modular API route organization
- Separation of concerns between layers

### Performance Considerations
- Database connection pooling
- Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Efficient query patterns with SQLAlchemy
- Caching strategy preparation (Redis integration)

### Security Considerations
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Environment variable security
- SQL injection prevention through ORM
- Input validation with Pydantic

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1: Structure Cleanup (Critical)
- Remove all directory files from `/backend/app/`
- Create proper Python files with basic structure
- Ensure all imports work correctly

### Day 2: Core Configuration
- Implement `app/core/config.py` with environment management
- Implement `app/core/database.py` with PostgreSQL connection
- Implement `app/core/security.py` with JWT utilities

### Day 3: Application Foundation
- Complete `app/main.py` with FastAPI application setup
- Implement health check endpoint
- Add basic error handling and CORS configuration
- Verify all components work together

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL database available
- Python 3.11+ environment
- All dependencies in requirements.txt installed

### Blocks/Blockers
- None identified for core structure implementation
- Database connection requires PostgreSQL setup (can be local for development)

## Open Questions

1. **Database Migration Strategy**: Should we implement Alembic migrations immediately or in a separate PRD?
2. **Monitoring Integration**: Do we need monitoring hooks in the core architecture or later?
3. **API Versioning**: Should we implement API versioning from the start?
4. **Rate Limiting**: Should rate limiting be part of the core architecture?

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Structure Corruption
- **Risk**: Accidentally breaking existing functionality during cleanup
- **Mitigation**: Create backup of current state, implement incrementally, test each step

### Medium Risk: Database Connection Issues
- **Risk**: Connection configuration problems causing startup failures
- **Mitigation**: Implement connection retry logic, provide clear error messages

### Low Risk: Environment Configuration
- **Risk**: Missing environment variables causing configuration errors
- **Mitigation**: Implement validation with helpful error messages, provide example .env file

This PRD provides the foundation for a clean, scalable FastAPI backend architecture that addresses the critical structure issues while establishing patterns for future development.
