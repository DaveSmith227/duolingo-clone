# Authentication System PRD

## Overview

This PRD defines the comprehensive authentication system for the Duolingo clone, focusing on secure user management, JWT token handling, and seamless session management. The system integrates with Supabase Auth while providing multi-provider social authentication (Google, Apple, Facebook, TikTok), secure session management, and GDPR-compliant user data handling. The authentication system serves as the foundation for user progress tracking and gamification features.

## Goals

- **Security First**: Implement industry-standard security practices with JWT tokens, secure session management, and protection against common attacks
- **Seamless User Experience**: Provide immediate access after registration with optional social authentication and "Remember Me" functionality  
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure data protection and user privacy rights with account deletion and data export capabilities
- **Admin Control**: Enable moderation capabilities and user management for platform safety
- **Integration Ready**: Design for seamless integration with progress tracking and gamification systems

## User Stories

### Core Authentication Flow
- **As a new user**, I want to register with email/password or social providers so that I can quickly start learning
- **As a new user**, I want immediate access after registration so that I don't have to wait for email verification
- **As a returning user**, I want to log in with multiple options (email, social) so that I can access my account conveniently
- **As a user**, I want "Remember Me" functionality so that I don't have to log in repeatedly on my device

### Password Management
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password via email (like Duolingo's flow) so that I can regain access to my account
- **As a user**, I want clear error messages when login fails so that I understand what went wrong
- **As a user**, I want automatic logout after inactivity so that my account stays secure on shared devices

### Data Privacy & Control
- **As a user**, I want to delete my account and all associated data so that I can exercise my GDPR rights
- **As a user**, I want to export my data so that I have control over my information
- **As a user**, I want to manage my profile information so that I can keep my details current

### Administrative Control
- **As an admin**, I want to moderate user accounts so that I can maintain platform safety
- **As an admin**, I want to view user activity logs so that I can investigate issues
- **As an admin**, I want to temporarily suspend accounts so that I can address policy violations

## Functional Requirements

2. **Social Registration**: Support Google, Apple, Facebook, and TikTok OAuth providers via Supabase Auth
3. **Immediate Access**: Users can access the platform immediately after registration without email verification
4. **Profile Completion**: Optional profile fields can be completed after initial registration
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: System must prevent duplicate accounts with the same email address

### User Authentication
6. **Multi-Provider Login**: Users can log in via email/password or any connected social provider
7. **Remember Me**: Optional persistent sessions with secure long-term tokens (30-day expiration)
