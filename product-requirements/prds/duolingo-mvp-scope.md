## Decision Framework

When evaluating new feature requests during development:

1. **Is it required for users to complete a lesson?** → P0
2. **Does it directly impact retention (streaks, goals)?** → P0
3. **Is it visible on the landing page screenshots?** → P0
4. **Would the app feel broken without it?** → P0
5. **Is it a nice enhancement to existing features?** → P1
6. **Can users learn Spanish without it?** → Out of scope
7. **Is it related to social/premium/AI features?** → Out of scope

## Notes

- This scope is designed for a solo developer using AI-assisted tools
- P1 features should only be started after ALL P0 features are complete
- Any scope changes must be documented and may impact timeline
- Post-MVP roadmap includes all "Out of Scope" features for future phases
- Text accuracy from screenshots is non-negotiable for brand authenticity
