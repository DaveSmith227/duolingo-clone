# API Endpoints Foundation PRD

## Overview

This PRD defines the foundational API endpoints required for the Duolingo clone MVP. These endpoints form the core infrastructure that supports user management, system health monitoring, and essential application functionality. All endpoints will follow REST conventions, implement proper authentication, and include comprehensive logging for learning analytics.

## Goals

1. **Establish Core API Infrastructure**: Create standardized endpoint patterns for user management and system monitoring
2. **Enable Learning Analytics**: Implement comprehensive logging for course completion, user progress, and A/B testing
3. **Ensure System Reliability**: Provide health check endpoints for monitoring system status and dependencies
4. **Support Authentication Flow**: Create secure endpoints for user registration, login, and profile management
5. **Enable Scalable Architecture**: Design endpoints that can handle MVP traffic and scale for future growth

## Technical Specifications

### API Design Standards
- **REST Conventions**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **JSON Format**: All requests and responses in JSON
- **Versioning**: API versioned as `/api/v1/` for future compatibility
- **Content-Type**: `application/json` for all endpoints

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "The email address is already in use",
    "details": {
      "field": "email",
      "value": "user@example.com"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials to `/api/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. JWT token included in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Protected endpoints validate token and extract user context
5. Refresh token used for extended sessions
