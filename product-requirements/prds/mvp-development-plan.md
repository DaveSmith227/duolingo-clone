## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Screenshot-Based Development Approach

1. **Design Token Extraction**:
   - Use AI vision to analyze each screenshot set
   - Extract exact colors, spacing, typography from images
   - Ignore "curated by Mobbin" watermarks consistently
   - Document responsive patterns across iOS and web screenshots

2. **Component Development Process**:
   - Start with landing page screenshots (highest priority)
   - Build iOS components first, then adapt for web
   - Ensure exact text reproduction from screenshots
   - Implement responsive behavior using web screenshot breakpoints

3. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Landing page → Authentication → Core learning loop
   - Focus on P0 features only until Week 5
   - Use decision framework from MVP scope document

### Architecture Decisions

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router for modern React patterns
- Tailwind CSS with extracted design tokens
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- Framer Motion for animations (Week 5+)

**Backend:**
- FastAPI for modern Python API development
- PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- JWT authentication with proper security
- Alembic for database migrations

**Development Workflow:**
- Screenshot analysis before each component
- Mobile-first responsive development
- Component-driven development with proper TypeScript
- Continuous deployment to staging environment

## Success Criteria

### MVP Launch Requirements (All P0 Features)
- ✅ Landing page pixel-perfect match to screenshots
- ✅ Users can register and log in successfully
